                Welcome to STARGEN!
***************************************************
Stargen is a Minecraft datapack for 1.17.1 aimed to
simulate a mix between Australian and fantasy styled
world-generation. It adds many new biomes to traverse
from tall mountains, branching forests, and lush
jungles to enchanted groves, sinister swamps, and
magical rivers.

Stargen is currently in a very beta state. Generation
shown may not be final, and it is not recommended to
put Stargen on a world that you like. However, feel
free to check out its generation! (:
